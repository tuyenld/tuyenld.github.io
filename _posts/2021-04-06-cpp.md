## `std::vector`

### std::vector::size vs std::vector::capacity

**std::vector::size**
Return size 

Returns the number of elements in the [vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector).  
  
This is the number of actual objects held in the [vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector), which is not necessarily equal to its storage [capacity](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector::capacity).

**std::vector::capacity**
Return size of allocated storage capacity 

Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated for the [vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector), expressed in terms of elements.  
  
This _capacity_ is not necessarily equal to the [vector size](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector::size). It can be equal or greater, with the extra space allowing to accommodate for growth without the need to reallocate on each insertion.  
  
Notice that this _capacity_ does not suppose a limit on the size of the [vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector). When this _capacity_ is exhausted and more is needed, it is automatically expanded by the container (reallocating it storage space). The theoretical limit on the [size](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector::size) of a [vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector) is given by member [max\_size](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector::max_size).  
  
The _capacity_ of a [vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector) can be explicitly altered by calling member [vector::reserve](https://www.cplusplus.com/vector::reserve).
