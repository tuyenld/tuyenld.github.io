This is a fork of [CleanPress](https://github.com/macjasp/cleanpress) (a fork of [Slash](https://github.com/tommy351/Octopress-Theme-Slash)); cleaner, without scripts, without remote content, without solarized. And you can use custom stylesheets adding `css: filename` in the YAML section of your pages.
