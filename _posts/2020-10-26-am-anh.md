## Sabrina Died April 5th 2018
Young Homeless Woman in Seattle Shares About Heroin Addiction. 

Sabrina is 23 and living under a bridge in Seattle. Sabrina and an old boyfriend hitchhiked to Seattle to spend a few weeks. Those weeks have now turned into four years of homelessness. 

Sabrina says she has been on her own since she was 16. She left her home town to explore the world, yet like so many other kids these days, she fell into the addiction of heroin. 

Cô ra đi ở tuổi 27, khi mà chỉ còn cách sinh nhật mình 3 tuần nữa.

> Hey, so this video is me almost 3 years ago. I'm doing a bit better now, Im still in Seattle, but have a part-time job at a pizzeria/bar downtown, I'm currently renting out an RV that I'm staying in but am looking for a place and should hopefully be getting into one hopefully in no longer than a month. As for addiction, I still struggle with it everyday, and I probably will for the rest of my life, but I'm in a much better place these days in all senses of the word, mentally, spiritually, and physically. im doing a lot better now then I was when this video was filmed, but I strive to do even better.

> Update: Hello to everyone that has watched my video and has left comments, I'm still doing better than I was. I was able to buy the RV that I was renting, but I am currently unemployed again but am looking for work. I've been going to Labor Ready 3 or 4 days a week to find temporary work for the day. Next fall, I am planning on going back to school hopefully at the Seattle Film Institute as I want to learn how to be a filmaker/producer/actress and I also want to go to school for journalism. I already have a passion for writing and would love to someday write a few books, and be able to share what I have been thru with other people and get them to understand and look at life from "the other side of the tracks." As for my addiction, it is still something I struggle with everyday, but I have an appointment next week to get on a Suboxone treatment program and , my heart is truly into using the Suboxone program to completely get off heroin. Anyway, thank you and God Bless everyone for your comments and blessings.
