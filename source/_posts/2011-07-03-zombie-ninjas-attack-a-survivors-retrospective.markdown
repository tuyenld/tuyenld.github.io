Here you can turn comments off or add categories to your post. If you are working on a multi-author blog, you can add author: Your Name to the metadata for proper attribution on a post. If you are working on a draft, you can add published: false to prevent it from being posted when you generate your blog. If you want to publish a linklog style post (blog entries point to external urls), simply add an external-url to your post.

You can add a single category or multiple categories like this.
